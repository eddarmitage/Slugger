## Overview
Instances of a `Slugger` object provide a way to generate _"slugs"_, that can
be used in URLs on the web. Inputs can be split into words in a variety of ways
and the length of the output can be restricted if required. Any `CharSequence`
can be used as the joining character between consecutive words. Characters that
would require escaping in a URL are removed or replaced, as appropriate.

## Getting Started
The simplest usage of `Slugger` would be something like the following:

    Slugger slugger = Slugger.create();
    String firstTitle = slugger.sluggify("My first blog post"); // my-first-blog-post
    String secondTitle = slugger.sluggify("Another post!"); // another-post

This creates an instance of a `Slugger` with the default configuration, which
splits the input on whitespace, removes special characters, and converts the
output to lowercase.

## Word Splitters
By default, a Slugger will split the supplied input into words based on
whitespace, although a number of alternative word splitters are provided (and
[the interface][word-splitter] is publicly exposed for extensibility).

To replace the default splitter, use the `withWordSplitter(WordSplitter ws)`
method as follows:

    Slugger slugger = Slugger.create().withWordSplitter(WordSplitters.camelCaseWordSplitter());
    slugger.sluggify("MyFirstBlogPost"); // my-first-blog-post

Splitters can also be _chained_, so you can split on both whitespace and
camel-case, as follows:

    Slugger slugger = Slugger.create().withAdditionalWordSplitter(WordSplitters.camelCaseWordSplitter());
    slugger.sluggify("The importance of toString()"); //the-importance-of-to-string
